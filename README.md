GitIt
======
This project is simply something for me to play with in my own time :-)

It aims to trawl and cache GIT repositories and contributions.

It uses Laravel 4.x and Composer.

## Install
To install, you must first [install composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) then:

	$ composer install

Or for dev:

	$ composer install --dev
